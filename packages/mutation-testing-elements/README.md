***Note:** Please see https://stryker-mutator.io for an introduction to mutation testing.*

## Features

The mutation test report supports the following features:

üìä Calculates and displays the mutation score and other metrics  
üìÅ Group results into directories  
üëì Show mutants directly in your source code  
üòé Code highlighting with [Prism](https://prismjs.com/)  
üßô‚Äç Filter mutants based on the outcome  
üîó Deep linking using anchors (uses fragment, so path will not be contaminated)  
‚ú® A nice (yet basic) UI with embedded [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) css  
üéì Adheres to [custom element best practices](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/best-practices)

## Install

Install with npm:

```shell
$ npm install mutation-testing-elements
```

Add to your page:

```html
<script defer src="mutation-test-elements/dist/mutation-test-elements.js"></script>
```

Or you can use the unpkg as your CDN: 

```html
<script defer src="https://www.unpkg.com/mutation-testing-elements"></script>
```

## Usage

Use the `mutation-test-report-app` element to load the mutation test report.

```html
<mutation-test-report-app src="mutation-report.json" title-postfix="Mutation Test Report"></mutation-test-report-app>
```

This loads the report from the source (`src`) and displays it. 

Alternatively, you can use property binding directly:

```html
<mutation-test-report-app></mutation-test-report-app>
<script>
    document.getElementsByTagName('mutation-test-report-app').item(0).report = {
        /* ... */
    }
</script>
```

Feel free to use other ways to bind the `report` property. For example, you can use `<mutation-test-report-app [report]="myReport"></mutation-test-report-app>` to bind `report` to the `myReport` property in an Angular component.

## Mutation testing report schema

The mutation testing report data is expected to be in the format of a the [mutation-testing-report-schema](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/mutation-testing-elements/tree/master/packages/mutation-testing-report-schema#readme). Please view that readme to understand the structure.

For some examples, please see the [testResources](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/mutation-testing-elements/tree/master/packages/mutation-testing-elements/testResources).

## API Reference

### `src` [`string`]

### `report` [`object`]

Default: `undefined`
