  * @param description Description of the applied mutation.
  * @param coveredBy The test ids that covered this mutant. If a mutation testing framework doesn't measure this information, it can simply be left out.
  * @param killedBy The test ids that killed this mutant. It is a best practice to "bail" on first failing test, in which case you can fill this array with that one test.
  * @param testsCompleted The number of tests actually completed in order to test this mutant. Can differ from `coveredBy` because of bailing a mutant test run after first failing test.
  * @param static A static mutant means that it was loaded once at during initialization, this makes it slow or even impossible to test, depending on the mutation testing framework.
